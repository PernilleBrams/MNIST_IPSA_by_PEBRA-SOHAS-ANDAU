# MNIST NN for IPSA 
### By: PEBRA, SOHAS, & ANDAU
This repo contains all code from the project part IPSA exam at AU by Pernille Brams &#129312;, SÃ¸ren Orm &#128591;, and Anna Daugaard &#128579;. 

The exam consists of building a neural network classifier for the MNIST dataset from scratch without using any built-in machine learning &#129302; frameworks in Python &#128013;.

This repository contains:
1. A document containing all code for the neural network and visualisations ([Final_Project-IV-MNIST.ipynb]).
      1. **Users should change the dirpath to their own dirpath.**
2. A folder containing gifs of the network weights after being exposed 99 images (MNIST_gifs).
3. A folder ('Visualizations') containing:
      1. A plot of 3000 network accuracies - the accuracies are saved after each batch (the full run is with 5 epochs and batch size 100).
      2. Plots of the weights in the network with the best accuracy.
      3. A plot of accuracies as the network learns.
      4. A plot of costs as the network learns.
4. A folder ('Networks [best is network3_469]') all momentary 'best networks' in terms of accuracy from a run with 5 epochs and batch size 100.
5. A folder with all relevant data for running the NN (MNIST).

NB: The code is written in Python 3.9.
