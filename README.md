# MNIST NN for IPSA 
### By: PEBRA, SOHAS, & ANDAU
This repo contains all code from the project part IPSA exam at AU by Pernille Brams &#129312;, SÃ¸ren Orm &#128591;, and Anna Daugaard &#128579;. 

The exam consists of building a neural network classifier for the MNIST dataset from scratch without using any built-in machine learning &#129302; frameworks in Python &#128013;.

This repository contains:
1. A document containing all code for the neural network and visualisations.
      1. **Users should change the dirpath to their own dirpath.**
2. A folder containing gifs of the network weights after being exposed 99 images.
3. A folder containing:
      1. A plot of 6000 network accuracies - the accuracies are saved after each batch (the full run is with 5 epochs and batch size 100).
      2. Plots of the weights in the network with the best accuracy - one plot for each digit.
      3. A plot of accuracies and the corresponding costs.
3. A folder with all relevant data for running the NN.
